# PROBLEM STATEMENT
# Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
# An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
# You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

# SOLUTION

# Use the brreadth-first search method
from typing import List
from collections import deque
